	<h1> I Always Knew That I Was Leaving </h1>

	<p class="first"> "I think that if leaving is a type of death then everyone i know has already out lived me."
		<br>
		"If leaving is a part of growth then i must be the part that needs to be shed" </p>
	<br>
	<p class="two">I envy things that cannot speak and so i speak for them:
		<div class="order">
		<ol type="I">
			<li>That a plant could stay rooted without being asked whether it belonged.</li>
			<li>That a bed would not need a passport to be part of a home.</li> 
			</ol> </div>
	</p>
	<p class="three"> I am laying out the last eight years of my life in visas and work authorizations.
		<div class="small">
		<ol type="i">
			<li>Calling myself an immigrant feels too much like a lie.</li>
			<li>I don't know how to explain to people that I am even less than that.</li>
		</ol> </div>
	</p>
	<p class="four">I am wondering about the person who sealed an envelope with their tongue with America inside.
	</p>
	<br>
	
		<P class="five"> here i thought that i had made myself American enough. Tamed my accent enough. Made it seem like i didn't mind the cold enough.</P>
<br>
		<p class="six"> <b>"Can't you see my whole life is here?" And the immigration officer would apologize and set me free.</b></p>
	<div class="Desire">
	<h2><b>Desire</b></h2>
	<p class="seven">A walking contradiction and a selfish person wrapped into one. When there is a cry, there is always a command with in. Demanding even in her whimpers.</p>
	<p class="eight"> <b> <i>"Fight For Me"</i></b> </p>
	<p class="nine">Although she is being forced to leave it's clear that the author wants nothing more than to be wanted. Constantly being uprooted allows for her to grow distraught and develop a contradicting persona of wanting to belong but knowing her place is not here with everyone else. This causes emotional strain. Her desires can not be met fully because it is out of her own hands.</p>
</div>
<h3>Truth</h3>
<p class="ten">You are running out of time.</p>
<div class="truth">
	<ol type="I">
		<li>There are things you will never get to do.</li>
		<li>You wanted something that felt like home but home is a fire and <i>it's smoking you out.</i></li>
	</ol>
</div>
<p class="eleven">Even when you try to accomodate for things, it doesn't change the fact that you can not copy or create a home in a place that is foreign to you when it doesn't give you the opportunity to, unless you choose to fight the adversity.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p class="twelve">Loving the person who set the blaze.</p>
<p class="trez">Sometimes we are drawn to things that remind us of our past lives even though we are on the search for better ones. Paralleles to the immigrant experience or new paths arising for any of us. When we find ourselves in new territory.</p>
